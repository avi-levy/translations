\section*{Introduction}
What follows constitutes the notes from a seminar that took place in Princeton in the autumn of 1957 on the works of Grothendieck;
the new results that are included are due to Grothendieck;
our contribution is solely of an editorial nature.

The ``Riemann-Roch theorem'' of which we speak here holds true for (non-singular) algebraic varieties over a field of arbitrary characteristic;
in the classical case, where the base field is $\mathbb{C}$, this theorem encapsulates, as a particular example, the result proven a few years ago by Hirzebruch \cite{9}.

The full statement and proof of the Riemann-Roch theorem can be found in sections 7 to 16, with the last section being devoted to an application.
Sections 1 to 6 contain some preliminaries on coherent algebraic sheaves \cite{12}.
The terminology that we follow is the same as in \cite{12}, up to one difference: to conform with a custom which is becoming more and more widespread, we use the word ``morphism'' instead of ``regular maps''.


\section{Supplementary results about sheaves}

(All the varieties considered below are algebraic varieties over an algebraically closed field $k$ of arbitrary characteristic. Unless otherwise mentioned, all the sheaves considered are coherent algebraic sheaves.)

\begin{proposition}{1}
\label{proposition1}
  Let $U$ be an open subset of a variety $V$, and let $\sh{F}$ be a coherent sheaf on $V$ and $\sh{G}$ a coherent subsheaf of $\sh{F}|U$ (the restriction of $\sh{F}$ to $U$).
  Then there exists a coherent sheaf $\sh{G}'\subset\sh{F}$ such that $\sh{G}'|U=\sh{G}$.
\end{proposition}

(In fact, the proof will show that there exists a \emph{largest} such sheaf having this property.)

\begin{proof}
  For every open subset $W\subset V$, we define $\sh{G}'_W$ as the set of sections of $\sh{F}$ over $W$ that belong to $\sh{G}$ over $U\cap W$.
  Everything reduces to showing that the sheaf $\sh{G}'$ associated to this presheaf is coherent.
  Since this is a local questions, we can suppose that $V$ is an affine variety.
  Let $A$ be its coordinate ring.
  There exist elements $f_i\in A$ such that $U=\bigcup V_{f_i}$, where $V_{f_i}=U_i$ denotes the set of points of $V$ where $f_i\neq0$.
  If, in the definition of $\sh{G}'$, we replace the open subset $U$ by the open subset $U_i$, then we obtain a sheaf $\sh{G}'_i\subset\sh{F}$, and it is clear that $\sh{G}'=\bigcap\sh{G}'_i$.
  By known results on coherent sheaves \cite[p.~209]{12}, it suffices to show that the $\sh{G}'_i$ are coherent.
  We can thus restrict to considering the case where $V$ is affine, and where $U=V_f$, for some $f\in A$.
  In this case, the sheaf $\sh{F}$ is defined by an $A$-module $M$, and the subsheaf $\sh{G}$ of $\sh{F}|U$ is defined by a submodule $N$ of $M_f=M\otimes_A A_f$.
  Let $N'$ be the inverse image of $N$ in $M$ under the canonical map $M\to M_f$.
  The module $N'$ then corresponds to a coherent subsheaf of $\sh{F}$, and we can immediately verify (by taking the $V_{f'}$ to be the $W$, for example) that this sheaf is exactly $\sh{G}'$, which finishes the proof.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}{1}
\label{lemma1}
  Let $U$ be an open subset of an affine variety $V$, and let $\sh{F}$ be a (coherent) sheaf on $U$.
  Then $\sh{F}$ is generated by its sections (over $U$).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $x\in U$, and let $f$ be a regular function on $V$, zero on $V\setminus U$ and non-zero at $x$.
  We have $V_f\subset U\subset V$.
  Since $V_f$ is affine, we know \cite{12} that $\sh{F}_x$ is generated by its sections over $V_f$, and it thus suffices to prove that these sections can be extended to $U$, after multiplying by a suitable power of $f$.
  This follows from the more general following lemma:
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}{2}
\label{lemma2}
  Let $X$ be a variety, $f$ a regular function on $X$, $\sh{F}$ a sheaf on $X$, and $s$ a section of $\sh{F}$ over $U=X_f$.
  Then there exists an integer $n>0$ such that $f^ns$ can be extended to a section of $\sh{F}$ over $X$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We can cover $X$ by finitely many affine opens $X_i$.
  By applying \cite[lemma~1, p.~247]{12} (or by arguing directly, as in \cref{proposition1}), we see that there exists an integer $n$ and sections $s_i$ of $\sh{F}$ over the $X_i$ that extend $f^ns$ over $X_i\cap U$.
  Since the $s_i-s_j$ are zero on $X_i\cap X_j\cap U$, there exists an integer $m$ such that $f^m(s_i-s_j)=0$ on $X_i\cap X_j$ (\cite[p.~235]{12}, or arguing directly), and $m$ can be chosen independent of the pair $(i,j)$.
  The $f^ms_i$ then define a section $s'$ of $\sh{F}$ over $X$ that indeed extend $f^{n+m}s$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}{2}
\label{proposition2}
  If $U$ is an open subset of a variety $V$, then every sheaf $\sh{F}$ over $U$ can be extended to $V$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  We show that, if $U\neq V$, we can extend $\sh{F}$ to an open subset $U'\supset U$, with $U'\neq U$;
  from that fact that every (strictly) increasing chain of open subsets stabilises, this will imply the proposition.
  Let $x\in V\setminus U$, and let $W$ be an affine open that contains $x$;
  let $U'=W\cup U$.
  We are thus led to extending the sheaf $\sh{F}|W\cap U$ to $W$, or, in other words, we can restrict to proving the proposition in the specific case where $V$ is affine.
  In this case, \cref{lemma1} shows that $\sh{F}$ is generated by its sections, i.e. it is of the form $\sh{L}/\sh{R}$, where $\sh{L}$ is the direct sum of the sheaves $\sh{O}_U$.
  The sheaf $\sh{L}$ can be extended in the obvious way to $V$, and, by \cref{proposition1}, there exists a subsheaf $\sh{R}'$ of $\sh{L}$ on $V$ whose restriction to $U$ is $\sh{R}$.
  The sheaf $\sh{L}/\sh{R}'$ is then the desired extension.
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
  \Cref{proposition1} and \cref{proposition2} correspond to the geometric fact that the closure of any algebraic subvariety of $U$ is an algebraic subvariety of $V$.
  These propositions do not extend \emph{as is} to the ``analytic'' case.
  The most we can hope for (by results of Rothstein) is that they still hold true if we make certain restrictions on the dimensions of $V\setminus U$ and the varieties appearing in the local primary decomposition of the sheaf $\sh{F}$.
\end{remark}


\section{Proper maps of quasi-projective varieties}

A variety $X$ is said to be \emph{quasi-projective} is it is isomorphic to a locally closed subvariety of a projective space.
It is said to be \emph{projective} if it is isomorphic to a closed subvariety of a projective space.
\emph{From here on in, all the varieties considered are assumed to be quasi-projective.}

\begin{lemma}{3}
\label{lemma3}
  Let $P$ be a projective space, $U$ an arbitrary variety, and $G$ a closed subset of $P\times U$.
  Then the projection of $G$ in $U$ is closed.
\end{lemma}

This is a translation into geometric language of the well-known fact that a projective space is a ``complete'' variety, in the sense of Weil.
We briefly recall the principal of the proof:

\begin{proof}
  Since the question is local with respect to $U$, we can assume that $U$ is affine, and even that $U$ is as affine open of the space $k^n$.
  We can also assume that $G$ is irreducible.
  So we choose projective coordinates $x_i$ in $P$ such that $G$ meets the set $P_0\times U$ of points where $x_0\neq0$.
  If $A$ denotes the coordinate ring of $U$, then the coordinate ring of the affine variety $P_0\times U$ is $A[x_i/x_0]=B_0$;
  the set $G$ defines (and is defined by) a prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $B_0$.
  If $\mathfrak{p}'$ denotes $A\cap\mathfrak{p}$, then the prime ideal $\mathfrak{p}'$ corresponds to the closure of the projection $G'$ of $G$ in $U$.
  A point in this closure is thus a homomorphism $f\colon A\to k$ (where $k$ denotes the base field) that is zero on $\mathfrak{p}'$;
  this point is the image of a point in $G$ that lies in $P_0\times U$ if and only if $f$ can be extended to a homomorphism $g\colon B_0\to k$ that is zero on $\mathfrak{p}$.
  So let $L$ be the field of functions of $G$;
  the field $L$ contains $A/\mathfrak{p}'$ as a subring.
  By the theorem of extension of specialisations, there exists a valuation $v$ of $L$, with values in $k$, that extends $f$.
  Let $\Phi$ be the place associated to this valuation.
  If $v(x_i/x_0)\geq0$ for all $i$, then the place $\Phi$ is finite over the $x_i/x_0$, and thus induces, on $B_0/\mathfrak{p}\subset L$, a homomorphism $g$ that extends $f$.
  If $v(x_i/x_0)<0$ for some $i$, then we replace $x_0$ by the $x_i$ that gives the smallest possible value of $v(x_i/x_0)$, and we are then back in the previous case.
\end{proof}

If $f\colon X\to Y$ is a morphism, then we write $G_f$ to denote its graph.
It is trivial that $G_f$ is closed in $X\times Y$.

\begin{lemma}{4}
\label{lemma4}
  Let $f\colon X\to Y$ and $g\colon Y\to Z$ be morphisms, where $X$ and $Y$ are subvarieties of projective spaces $P$ and $P'$ (respectively).
  Suppose that $G_f$ is closed in $P\times Y$, and that $G_g$ is closed in $P'\times Z$.
  Then $G_{gf}$ is closed in $P\times Z$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We have $G_f \subset P\times Y = P\times G_g \subset P\times P'\times Z$, and since each one is closed in the next, we see that $G_f$ can be identified with a closed subset of $P\times P'\times Z$.
  Since $G_{gf}$ is exactly the projection of $G_f$ to the factor $P\times Z$, the lemma follows from \cref{lemma3}.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}{5}
\label{lemma5}
  Let $f\colon X\to Y$ be a morphism, and let $X\subset P$ and $X\subset P'$ be embeddings of $X$ into projective spaces.
  If $G_f$ is closed in $P\times Y$, then it is also closed in $P'\times Y$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We apply \cref{lemma4} to the morphisms $X\xrightarrow{i}X\xrightarrow{f}Y$, where $i$ denotes the identity morphism.
  Everything then reduces to showing that the graph $G_i$ of $i$ in $P\times X$ is closed, which follows from the fact that it is given by the intersection of $P\times X$ with the diagonal of $P\times P$.
\end{proof}

\Cref{lemma5} justifies the following definition:

\begin{definition}
  A map $f\colon X\to Y$ is said to be \emph{proper} if it is a morphism and if its graph $G_f$ is closed in $P\times Y$, where $P$ is a projective space containing $X$.
\end{definition}

We can give a definition of proper maps that is analogous to the definition of complete varieties:

\begin{proposition}{3}
\label{proposition3}
  For a morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ to be proper, it is necessary and sufficient, for every variety $Z$, and every closed subset $T$ of $X\times Z$, for the image of $T$ in $Y\times Z$ to be closed.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Let $P$ be a projective space inside which $X$ can be embedded;
  since $G_f$ is closed in $P\times Y$, the product $G_f\times Z$ is closed in $P\times Y\times Z$, and so $T$ can be embedded as a closed subset into $P\times Y\times Z$.
  Applying \cref{lemma3}, we see that the projection of $T$ to $Y\times Z$ (which is exactly $(f\times1)(T)$) is closed.
  Conversely, suppose that this property holds true, and apply it to $Z=P$, with the set $T$ being the diagonal of $X\times X$, embedded into $X\times P$.
  The image of $T$ in $Y\times Z=Y\times P$ is then exactly $G_f$, which is indeed closed.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}{4}
\label{proposition4}
  \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
    \item The identity morphism $i\colon X\to X$ is proper.
    \item The composition of two proper maps is proper.
    \item The direct product of two proper maps is proper.
    \item The image of a closed subset by a proper map is a closed subset.
    \item An injection $Y\to X$ is proper if and only if $Y$ is closed in $X$.
    \item Every morphism from a projective variety is proper.
    \item A projection $Y\times Z\to Y$ is proper if and only if $Z$ is projective (assuming the variety $Y$ to be non-empty).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  We indicate, as an example, how to prove \emph{(vii)} (since the other claims are even easier to prove).
  If $Z$ is projective, then we apply the criteria of \cref{proposition3};
  so let $Z'$ be an arbitrary variety, and $T$ a closed subset of $Y\times Z\times Z'$;
  we need to show that the projection of $T$ in $Y\times Z'$ is closed, which follows from \cref{lemma3}.
  Conversely, if $Y\times Z\to Y$ is proper, then the composition $Z\to Y\times Z\to Y$ is proper.
  Since the image of this map is a point, we immediately deduce that $Z$ is projective (by returning to the definition).
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}{5}
  For a morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ to be proper, it is necessary and sufficient for it to factor as $X\to P\times Y\to Y$, where $X\to P\times Y$ is an injection into a closed subvariety, and $P\times Y\to Y$ is the projection onto the second factor (where $P$ denotes some projective space).
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
  By the definition of a proper map, this condition is necessary (if we take $P$ to be a projective space into which we can embed $X$).
  It is sufficient by \emph{(ii)}, \emph{(v)}, and \emph{(vii)}.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}{5}
  Suppose that the base field $k$ is the field of complex numbers.
  For a morphism $f\colon X\to Y$ to be proper (in the above sense), it is necessary and sufficient for it to be proper (in the topological sense) when we endow $X$ and $Y$ with the ``usual'' topology.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose that
