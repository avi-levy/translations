\section*{Introduction}

\oldpage{137}
In this appendix, we will develop an axiomatic theory of Chern classes that will allow us, in particular, to define the Chern classes of an algebraic vector bundle $E$ on a non-singular quasi-projective algebraic variety $X$ as elements of the Chow ring $A(X)$ of $X$, i.e. as classes of cycles under rational equivalence.
This expos\'{e} is inspired by the book of Hirzebruch on one hand (where the essential \emph{formal properties} characterising a theory of Chern classes was brought to light), and by an idea of Chern \cite{2} that consists of using the multiplicative structure of the ring of classes of cycles on bundle of projective spaces $P(E)$ associated to $E$, to reach an effective \emph{construction} of Chern classes.
We note that the exposition given here also applies to other settings than algebraic geometry, and recovers, for example, an entirely elementary theory of Chern classes for complex vector bundles on topological manifold (and, from this, on any space for which the classification theorem of principal bundles with a structure group via a ``classifying space'' holds true).
Similarly, we will obtain, for a complex-analytic vector bundle $E$ on a (non-singular) complex-analytic manifold $X$, Chern classes
\[
  c_p(E) \in \HH^p(X,\Omega_X^p),
\]
where $\Omega_X^p$ is the sheaf of germs of holomorphic differential forms of degree $p$ on $X$.
[And it is certainly easy to prove that this definition agrees with that given recently by Atiyah \cite{1}, and that it is linked to the topological definition of Chern classes via the spectral sequence linking $\HH^p(X,\Omega_X^q)$ and $\HH^\bullet(X,\mathbb{C})$.]
Similarly, the theory of
\oldpage{138}
Stiefel-Whitney classes in cohomology mod~$2$ fits into the framework that we will describe here.

It appears that a satisfying theory of Chern classes in algebraic geometry has been given, for the first time, by W.L.~Chow (unpublished), using the Grassmannian.
The main aim of the current paper has been to eliminate the Grassmannian from the theory.
I have already shown \cite{4} how the theory of Chern classes allows us to \emph{recover} the structure of $A(X)$ when $X$ is a Grassmannian.


\section{Notation}
\label{section1}

In order to not expose ourselves to the complications arising from the theory of intersections, we will limit ourselves in what follows to considering only \emph{non-singular} topological spaces.
The base field $k$ will be fixed once and for all, and to better understand the ideas, the reader can assume it to be algebraically closed.
All the bundles, subvarieties, morphisms, etc. that we consider in what follows will be defined over $k$.

If $X$ is an algebraic space, and $E$ a vector bundle on $X$, then we denote by $\PP(E)$ the associated projective bundle.
The fibre $\PP(E)_x$ of $\PP(E)$ at a point $x\in X$ is thus the projective space associated to the vector space $E_x$, and so a point of $\PP(E)_x$ over a point $x\in X$ is exactly a homogeneous line in $E_x$.
Let $f\colon\PP(E)\to X$ be the projection of the bundle;
we will consider the inverse image of $E$ under $f$, which is the vector bundle $f^{-1}(E)$ on $\PP(E)$.
There is a canonical rank~$1$ subbundle of $f^{-1}(E)$, whose fibre at a point $d$ of $\PP(E)$ (over a point $x\in X$) is the line $d$ in $E_x=f^{-1}(E)_d$.
The dual bundle of this subbundle of $f^{-1}(E)$ is denoted $L_E$, and we thus have the inclusion
\[
  \check{L}_E \subset f^{-1}(E).
\]

Let $p$ be the rank of $E$ (assumed to be constant, which is always the case if $X$ is connected).
Then $E^{(1)}=f^{-1}(E)/L_E$ is a vector bundle of rank $p-1$ on $X^{(1)}=\PP(E)$, and we can thus construct $X^{(2)}=\PP(E^{(1)})$ and the analogous bundle $E^{(2)}=(E^{(1)})^{(1)}$ of rank $p-2$ on $X^{(2)}$.
We thus inductively construct manifolds $X^{(i)}$ and vector bundles $E^{(i)}$ of rank $p-i$ on $X^{(i)}$ ($1\leq i\leq p$), where $X^{(i)}$ is the bundle $\PP(E^{(i-1)})$ on $X^{(i-1)}$.
We define a \emph{flag of length $i$} in a vector space $V$ to be an increasing sequence $(V_j)_{0\leq j\leq i}$ of vector subspaces $V_j$, with $\dim V_j=j$.
Then $X^{(i)}$ can also be understood as the \emph{bundle on $X$ of flags of length $i$} in $E$, and if $f^{(i)}$ is the projection from $X^{(i)}$ to $X$, then we directly define, as in the definition of $L_E$, an increasing sequence of subbundles $(V_j)_{0\leq j\leq i}$ of $E_i=(f^{(i)})^{(-1)}(E)$, with $\rank(V_j)=j$, and the quotient of $E_i$ by $V_i$ being exactly the vector bundle $E^{(i)}$.
In particular, $X^{(p)}$ is the \emph{flag manifold} (of maximum length $p$) $D(E)$ of $E$, which thus appears as a ``multiple extension'' of $X$ by fibrations in projective spaces associated to vector bundles\todo;
the inverse image $E_p$ of $E$ in $X^{(p)}=D(E)$ is further \emph{completely split}.
By this, we mean that this vector bundle of rank~$p$ is endowed with a sequence $(V_i)_{0\leq i\leq p}$ of vector subbundles,
\oldpage{139}
with $\rank(V_i)=i$.
Then the $V_i/V_{i-1}$ ($1\leq i\leq p$) are vector bundles of rank~$1$, and are called the \emph{factors} of the given splitting.
