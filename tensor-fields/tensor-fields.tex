The theory of elementary particles consists of associating, to each type of particle, a field.
The field is chosen according to the spin of the particle.
According to the means of description, the fields can be classified into two categories.
Firstly, there are the \emph{spinorial fields}, whose variables are spinors ($\psi_{\alpha\beta\ldots}$) that satisfy first-order differential equations of the following type:
\[
  \left(\gamma_\lambda \diffp{}{{x_\lambda}} + \HH\right)\psi = 0
\]
where $\gamma_\lambda$ is four matrices belonging to a certain non-commutative algebra [L.~de~Broglie, N.~Kemmer].
With spinorial fields, we can account for half-integer-spin particles as well as integer-spin particles.
A spinor with a single index $(\psi_\alpha)$ represents a field of spin~$\frac12$.
A spinorial field with two indices $(\psi_{\alpha\beta})$ does not correspond to a specific well-defined spin, but it can be reduced to a field of total spin~$1$ and a field of spin~$0$ with a zero component.
It is thus a field of maximum total spin~$1$.

In the particular case of integer spin, the description of fields can be given, in a different way, by means of tensors $(\Psi_{\lambda,\rho})$ satisfying second-order differential equations [A.~Proca, N.~Kemmer, M. Fierz].
Since the fundamental second-order differential operator is $\square-\HH^2$, the field equations are equations of Dalembertien type:
\[
  \Big(\square-\HH^2\Big)\Psi = 0.
\]
If $\Psi$ is a scalar, then the field represents particles of spin~$0$.
A vector field does not correspond to a well-defined spin.
If we also require it to satisfy the condition of zero divergence, then it will be a field of total spin~$1$.
If not, it has four independent components, and we can prove that it represents a superposition of four states of well-defined spin: three states of spin~$1$, and one of spin~$0$.
These spin states can be separated in an explicit way (for $\HH\neq0$).
The vector field is thus also, like the spinorial field with two indices,
\oldpage{13-02}
a field of maximum total spin~$1$.

In general, a tensor field without additional conditions does not represent a well-defined spin, but a mixture of certain well-defined spins.
Each non-zero component of the tensor corresponds to a certain spin states.
The spin states can be decomposed in an explicit way (for $\HH\neq0$).
Also, the field does not have a positive defined total energy.
But the decomposition of the spin states is also the covariant decomposition of the positive and negative parts of the total energy.


\section{Free fields}
\label{section1}

The Lagrangian of a tensor field $(\Psi_{\alpha_1\ldots\alpha_n})$ of rank $n$ is
\[
  \LL = -\frac12\left(
    \diffp{\Psi}{{x_\lambda}} \diffp{\Psi}{{x_\lambda}} + \HH^2\Psi\Psi
  \right).
\]
The stress-energy tensor of the field can then be written as
\[
  T_{\mu\nu} = \frac12\left[
    \diffp{\Psi}{{x_\mu}} \diffp{\Psi}{{x_\nu}}
    + \diffp{\Psi}{{x_\mu}} \diffp{\Psi}{{x_\nu}}
    -\delta_{\mu\nu}\left(
      \diffp{\Psi}{{x_\lambda}} \diffp{\Psi}{{x_\lambda}} + \HH^2\Psi\Psi
    \right)
  \right],
\]
and the total stress-energy as
\[
  P_\nu = \frac1c \int_\sigma T_{\mu\nu}\d\sigma_\mu.
\]
By the general principle of variation of the Lagrangian formalism, the total angular momentum of the field is composed of two parts: $M_{\mu\nu}+S_{\mu\nu}$, where $M_{\mu\nu}$ is the orbital angular momentum
\[
  M_{\mu\nu} = \frac1c \int_\sigma (x_\mu T_{\lambda\nu} - x_\nu T_{\lambda\mu}) \d\sigma_\lambda
\]
and $S_{\mu\nu}$ is the spin of the field
\[
  S_{\mu\nu} = \frac1c \int_\sigma S_{\lambda\mu\nu} \d\sigma_\lambda
\]
where
\begin{align*}
  S_{\lambda\mu\nu} = \sum_{i=1}^n \Bigg[
    &\diffp{{\Psi_{\alpha_1\ldots\alpha_{i-1}\alpha_\mu\alpha_{i+1}\ldots\alpha_n}}}{{x_\lambda}} \Psi_{\alpha_1\ldots\alpha_{i-1}\alpha_\nu\alpha_{i+1}\ldots\alpha_n}
    \\-&
    \diffp{{\Psi_{\alpha_1\ldots\alpha_{i-1}\alpha_\nu\alpha_{i+1}\ldots\alpha_n}}}{{x_\lambda}} \Psi_{\alpha_1\ldots\alpha_{i-1}\alpha_\mu\alpha_{i+1}\ldots\alpha_n}
  \Bigg]
\end{align*}
